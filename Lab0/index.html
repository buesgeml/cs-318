        <h3>Junior</h3>
        <p>I took this class so that the communications portion of my major included some computer science as well. I hope to learn how to make a personal website and potentially client websites as well.</p>
        <h4>My Favorite Things</h4>
        <p>Three of my favorite things are walks, painting, and my family. Painting is my favorite art medium and the class I am most excited for this semester.</p>

<h1>Most Common Flowers of Wisconsin</h1>
<p>Here are some flowers that grew without anyone planting them; this includes native species, along with non-native plants that were brought here both intentionally and unintentionally, and established themselves, returning year after year on their own.</p>
<p>The flowers grow in forests, prairies, roadsides and other untended areas. They are very important to wildlife in the area as they contribute to the ecosystem and its yearly cycles. This website also includes links to the Wisconsin state flower and information about it, as well as other native Wisconsin Flowers.</p>

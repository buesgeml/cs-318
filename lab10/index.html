        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>The Galloping Goose was established in<br>1873 by my great-grandmother, Marike.<br>She inherited from her father a 23 acre<br>apple orchard and his prized goose Gertrude<br>at the age of 16. In the beginning<br>she would sell cider and pies on the edge of<br>town to the villagers. Eventually she saved<br>enough turn the farmhouse at the end of<br>her land into The Galloping Goose. Over<br>the last century The Galloping Goose has<br>been handed down to the eldest daughter<br>who keeps the legacy of the pub alive.</p>

    <h1>Walks</h1>
    <p>Louie's other favorite thing in the whole world is going for walks. "Walk" is probably his favorite word of all time (followed by the word "treat," of course). He likes to walk in the sun, rain, and snow; it doesn't matter to him. Obviously, his favorite person to walk with is my dad, and he gets restless if they dont go for their morning walk. With my dad, he behaves perfectly, but for everyone else, he tends to tug on the leash a bit. I decided to attach a video here for some walking dog walking tips, hopefully my mom and I can use some of them on Louie!</p>

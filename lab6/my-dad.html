   <h1>My Dad</h1> 
   <p>Even though I picked out Louie as a puppy and spent hours upon hours picking the perfect dog, he ended up liking my dad the best. At first, I must admit I was a little jealous, and I would go the extra mile to try to get him to like me more, but my efforts were unsuccessful. My dad is his favorite humanand best friend in the whole world, and there is a good chance he is my dad's best friend too.<br>Together, Louie and dad wake up early, go for walks togther (no matter how cold), watch TV together, and simply just coexist. Louie follows my dad like a shadow, and on the weekends, when dad sleeps in, Louie waits at the foot of the stairs until his duties of "follower" can finally begin for the day.<br>
    Here is one of my favorite pictures of Dad and Louie.</p>
